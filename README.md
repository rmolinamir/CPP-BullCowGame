# CPP-BullCowGame
Bulls &amp; Cows Word Console Game - My First C++

This is the console executable game, that makes use of the BullCowClass and a main.cpp file that handles user interaction and views. The file main.cpp acts as the view in a MVC pattern, and is responsible for all user interaction. For game logic see the FBullCowClass class. For the isogram collection see the FIsogramCollection class.

### How to run
Import these files into Visual Studio, or whichever IDE you are using, let the compiler do it's job then run the code on the console.

You can import the files by typing the following line into your terminal:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rmolinamir/CPP-BullCowGame
```
